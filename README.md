# Temperature measuring

**What is this?**

This project is a system for reading out temperature sensor data, logging it in CSV files and monitoring the values on a real time dashboard.

It consists of a backend application written in python which handles the reading and logging of sensor data and a dashboard webapp written in VueJS.

Supported sensor types are DHT22 and DS18B20.

The two programs were developed to work on a Raspberry Pi 4 with Raspbian as operating system. They might also work on other Linux systems.
